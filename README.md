### Built With
* Vanilla javascript


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

the game is "working" => there are still lots of issues to fix but i did learn a lot of things such as : 

1. My Game manager in gameManager.js is an object and within an object it is considered bad practice to directly put some code. It is better to place the code in an instance of the object.

2. I should really have done a flowChart because now, when i am trying to debug, even with some good help, it is super hard since ive wrote part that i do not remember why i wrote them ( such as the error .action for instance, which is not in the HTML)

3. Next time i will prepare a nice flowchart and pay way more attention to the small details because i made a lot of syntaxic error and forgot (,; []) ....
